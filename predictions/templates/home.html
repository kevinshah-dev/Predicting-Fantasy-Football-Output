		Welcome to our site! Using this platform, users can search up any NFL player in the database and look at an individual NFL playerâ€™s current and projected fantasy statistics for the 2021-2022 season. This website was created for our CS 216 final project. We used several different technologies to develop this including Django, Python, and Seaborn. Enjoy!
